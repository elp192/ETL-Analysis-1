# Overview of the Project
In this project, the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process is performed on the dataset (i.e., [wikipedia data](https://github.com/elp192/ETL-Analysis-1/blob/5f60c07dc34687ee747dd730dcf32d9d6824dc24/data/wikipedia-movies.json), [movies metadata](https://github.com/elp192/ETL-Analysis-1/blob/5f60c07dc34687ee747dd730dcf32d9d6824dc24/data/movies_metadata.csv), and [ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=ratings.csv)). This ETL process prepares the data for the future project, predicting which of the released movies with a low budget can be popular.<br>
The following files are created to perform the ETL process:

1. [Link to **function_test**](https://github.com/elp192/ETL-Analysis-1/blob/5f60c07dc34687ee747dd730dcf32d9d6824dc24/function_test.ipynb) file
- Extracted Wikipedia and Kaggle data (kaggle metadata and ratings), which are in the format of JSON and CSV, respectively.
- Converted/extracted data into DataFrames.
